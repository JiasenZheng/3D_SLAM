# 3D SLAM and Point Cloud Colourisation

The package implement 3D SLAM using Rtab-map ros package on a Jackal UGV. The Jackal is equipped with a Velodyne lidar and a realsense camera. A point cloud colourisation algorithm and a extrinsic calibration package are also developed in the project. A detailed explaintion of the project can be found in my [portfolio post](https://jiasenzheng.github.io/projects/0-slam-and-point-cloud-colourisation). The instructions of calibration can be found in the [README](https://github.com/JiasenZheng/velo2rs_calibration) of the calibration package.
